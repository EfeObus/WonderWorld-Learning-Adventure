    Network Security Configuration for WonderWorld Learning Adventure
    
    This configuration enforces security best practices:
    - Blocks cleartext (HTTP) traffic in production
    - Enforces HTTPS for all network connections
    - Enables certificate transparency logging
    
    Since this is a children's educational app, we have minimal 
    network requirements and prioritize security.

        Note: This app primarily works offline with local storage (Hive).
        Network is only used for:
        - Voice recognition (speech_to_text API calls)
        - Text-to-speech engine updates
        
        No user data is transmitted to external servers.
